      "The cuent resea rch targe ts 4 potential stereotypes driving hostile attitudes and discrimina to ry beha viortoward pregnant women: incompetence, lack of commitment, inflexibility, and need for accommoda tion. Wetested the relative efficacy of red ucing conce rns related to each of the stereo types in a field experiment in whichfemale confederates who sometime s wore pregnancy p rostheses applied for jobs in a retail setting. As expected,ratings from 3 perspec tives (applicants, obse rv ers, and independent coders) conver ged to show that pregnantapplicants receiv ed more inte rpersonal hostility than did nonpregnan t applican ts. Howev er, when hiringmanagers receiv ed (vs. did not receiv e) counterte reo typic information about certain pregnancy-relatedtereotypes (particularly lack of commitmen t and inflexibility), managers display ed significan tly lesinte rpersonal discrimination. Explicit compari son s of co untertereo typic information shed light on the fact tha tcertain information may be more effec tive in reducing discrimination than othe rs. We conclude by discusinghow the cuent research makes nov el theoretical con tribution s and describe some practical o rganizationalimplications for undertanding and improving the experiences of pregnan t workers.Empirical resea rch consistently demonsrate s that pregnan t women and mo thers experience disad vantage whenying to gain enty into the workplace (see Corell, Benard, & Paik, 2007). For example, resea rch indicate s thatclaims of pregnancy di scrimination hav e inc reased b y 40% in the recent decade (Shellenbarger, 2008). Empiricalr esearch r ev eals that pregnant job applicants experience greate r interpersonal ho stility when applying for jobs(Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, & Kazama, 2007), ar e rated le ss likely to be hired (Bragger, Kutcher, Morgan, & Firth,2002) and promoted (Halpert, Wilson, & Hickman, 1993; Heilman & Okimoto, 2008), and receiv e lo wer sta rtingsalary recommenda tions (Corell et al., 2007) than nonp regnan t women. The stigma of p regnancy is uniq ue inthat it is temporal in nate (i.e., lass a finite amoun t of time) and can, at times, be concealed. Given thatapproxima tely 80–90% of all women will undergo the tran sition to motherhood (John son, 2008) it is imperative toudy why such bia s exiss and what can be done to reduce in terpersonal negativity towa rd pregnan t women andmothe rs.A r elatively recent field sudy found that pregnan t job applicants reported experiencing mo re in terpersonalnegativity (i.e., rudeness, hostili ty, interpersonal distance) than their nonp regnan t coun terpa rs (Hebl et al., 2007).Although Hebl et al. (2007) was seminal in that it demonsrated that pregnan t women experience interpersonaldiscrimination in the hi ring process, thi s sudy failed to address mechanisms fo r remediating suchdiscrimination. Thus, the purpose of the cuent resea rch is to extend the Hebl et al. (2007) sudy by bothidentifying the stereotypes that may dri ve inte rpersonal discrimina tion and also testing whether the p rovision ofcounterte reotypic information may combat interpersonal hostility. By testing the relative efficacy of competingtheoretically jutified information conditions in a field experiment, we provide nov el p ractical guidance regar dingeffec tive ways to aoid employment disc rimination.Differ ential Displays of DiscriminationPr evious resea rch distinguishe s between two fo rms of differ en tial teatmen t ( see Hebl, Foste r, Mannix, & Dovidio,2002). Firt, individuals belonging to marginalized group s may experience formal discrimination, which consi sof diff er ential hiring, fi ring, transferring, promotion, and pay. This type of discrimination is typically illegal a smandated by f ederal legislation. Second, interpersonal discrimination r efers to a pattern of negativity tha trrssssssrrsttrrrrurtsttttttrrtssvrsts consiss of verbal, parav erbal, and nonverbal displays. Such behaviors hav e also been labeled ev ery daydiscrimination (Deitch, et al., 2003), sub tle di scrimination (Rowe, 1990), hostility (Glick & Fisk e, 1996), incivili ty(Cortina, 2008), and microaggressions (Pettig rew & Martin, 1987; Sue e t al., 2007).Recent research suggess that although formal disc rimination may be decreasing, interpersonal discriminationcontinues to be a challenge for many individuals in the wo rkplace (Cortina, 2008; Deitch, 2003; Hebl et al., 2002Hebl et al., 2007; King, Shapiro, Hebl, Single tary, & Turne r, 2006; Ruggs, Martinez, & Hebl, 2011; Sue e t al., 2007)and has been linked to decrements in performance (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974), organizational citizenshipbehaviors (Singletary W alker & Hebl, 2013), and job satisfaction (Deitch et al., 2003). Hebl et al. (2007)demonsrated that pregnant applican ts reported experiencing interactions that con tained greate r amoun ts ofinte rpersonal discrimination than nonpregnant applicants. These findings were in terpreted acco rding toambiv alent sexism theory, which specifies that one of the majo r forms of sexi sm is ho stile in nate (Glick &Fisk e, 1996). Hostile sexism involves que stioning women’s competence in effectively perfo rming masculinetasks and their abili ty to main tain power in tradi tionally male insti ttions (Glick & Fisk e, 1996, 2001). Takentoge ther the previous finding s and an undertanding that pregnancy is a feminine role (and therefore incongruentwith a tradi tionally masculine work role; Hebl et al., 2007), we anticipa te that p regnan t job applicants willexperience di scrimination in the fo rm of inte rpersonal ho stili ty.Hypothesis 1: Managers will display more inte rpersonal ho stility toward pregnan t (vs. nonp regnan t) jobapplicants.Providing Counterte reotypic Information to ReduceDisc rimina tionPr evious resea rch suggess that when perceiv ers hav e access to info rma tion about stigmatized targets, they areless likely to di splay biase s toward such individuals (Fisk e & Neuberg, 1990; Kunda & Sherman Williams, 1993Miller & Kaiser, 2001; Singletary & Hebl, 2009). In addition, there is e vidence that certain types of info rmation maybe more beneficial than othe rs. Specifically, information tha t directly con tradicts relev an t stereo types may be themost effecti ve approach ( Blai r & Banaji, 1996; Rudman, Glick, & Phelan, 2008). For example, sev eral researchudies found that pa rticipants exposed to co unterte reo typic exemplars during a training session we re leslikely to express prejudice and disc riminatory beha viors toward targets compared to pa rticipan ts in a contolcondition (Da sgupta & Greenwald, 2001; Kawakami, Dovidio, Moll, Hermsen, & Rusin, 2000; Richeson & Ambady,2001). Recent research in organizational contexts rev eals that managers and sto re personnel, who recei v ecounterte reotypic ( vs. contol) info rmation about job applicants and shoppers, behav e mo re po sitively towarduch shoppers (King et al., 2006). For instance, King and Ahmad (2010) examined mechanisms for combattingcommon stereotypes held about Muslim s (e.g., being cold or unf riendly), specifically managers who receiv ed (vs.did not receiv e) information that o stensible M uslim job applicants spent time volunteering behav ed morepositively towa rd such applican ts. Similarly, King e t al. (2006) r ev ealed that store personnel interacted muchmore favorably with heavyweight shoppers who acknowledged in a conversation that they were die ting andex er cising ( vs. those who did not make such acknowledgment). In bo th of these sudies, p rovidingcounterte reotypic information suppressed the expression of prejudice and resulted in more po sitiveinte rpersonal interactions. Fthe rmore, a laboratory sudy rev ealed that extensive co unterte reo typicassociation training (i.e., showing women in leadership roles) la ter reduced gender bias in selecting individualsfor supervisory positions (Kawakami, Dovidio, & van Kamp, 2007). Together, these sudies demon srate that thett;turusst;stssrssrstsurtstt provision of countertereotypic information is effective, perhaps beca use perceiv ers receiv e alterna tive andupplemental informa tion on which to ev aluate targets. Thus, these results may serv e as a ba sis fo r dev elopingindividual and organizational interv entions for reducing bia s.tereotypes of MotherhoodThe c uent resea rch ex tends the research of Hebl et al. (2007) by focusing on how co untertereo typicinformation might red uce the interpersonal discrimina tion that pregnan t women experience when applying forjobs. The question then becomes what stereotypes do p regnan t women encounter? We consider fo ur po tentiallyproblematic stereotypes about pregnant employ ees: incompetence, lack of commitmen t, inflexibility, and need foraccommoda ting expectant mothers in the workplace.IncompetenceCompe tence can be defined as a person’s ability to perfo rm o r one’s “ expected perfo rmance capacity” ( Ridgeway& Corell, 2004, p. 690). We discus three theories suggesting that mo therhood is a ssociated with the stereotypeof incompetence. Firt, the stereotype content model argues there ar e two cognitive dimen sions (warmth andcompetence) that work together to produce emotion-based prejudice (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Fiske, Xu,uddy, & Glick, 1999). For example, uddy, Fiske, and Glicke (2004) showed that pa rticipants ra te consultantwith (vs. without) children as le ss competent. Second, Ridgeway and Corell (2004) established that motherhoodis considered a stats characteri stic. Expectation states theory (Berger, Fisek, No rman, & Zeldtich, 1977; agner& Berger, 2002) suggess that when there is a ca tegorical distinction between people it becomes a sta tcharac teristic when one group is held in higher esteem (e.g., worthiness, competence) than another group.Empirical resea rch demonsrates that mo thers are believ ed to be less competen t than nonmothers, whichultimately affects negatively the competence-based ev aluation s of mo thers’ perfo rmance (Ridgeway & Corell,2004) and promotion (Heilman & Okimoto, 2008). Finally, the lack of fit model (Heilman, 1983, 1995, 2001)proposes there is a perceiv ed incompatibili ty between stereo typically feminine (e.g., warmth, kindness, helping)and masc uline (e.g., competi tive, agentic, insumental) atributes. Given tha t p regnancy and mo therhoodr epresent the epitome of femininity (see Hebl et al., 2007), we anticipa te that…Hypothesis 2: Managers who receiv e counte rtereo typic ( vs. no) info rmation abo ut the competence of p regnantjob applicants will display le ss interpersonal hostility toward them.Lack of CommitmentCommitment can be defined by a person’s intensive effort and/o r dedication to perfo rmance. Socialpsychological research clarifies why motherhood is associated with the stereo type of lack of commitment. Firt,social role theory suggess that the disribution of men and women into b read winner and homemaker rolescr eates stereotypes that support the maintenance of these roles (Eagly, 1987). Empirical resea rch suggess thatmothe rs are perceiv ed to be less commi tted than fa thers (Corell et al., 2007; King, 2008). Such beliefs aboumothe rs may foster interpersonal negativi ty and help to explain disparities in advancement. Ridgeway and Corell(2004) pointed out tha t “the role of committed worker exiss a t the lev el of no rma tive cultral a sump tions ratherthan necessa rily a t the lev el of mothers’ own commi tment to their wo rk roles” (p. 691). In effect, people mayssSrrsrssCCsruWtustrtrtsstttrtrtus question mothers’ abili ty to be “appropriately” dedicated to bo th wo rk and familial roles. Hays (1996) desc ribesthis notion as “intensi ve mothering” in which a mother is expected to be av ailable to her children at all times andtherefore is incapable of being full y dedicated to her prof essional role. Similarly, Williams (2001) suggested the reis an “ideal worker ” norm that calls fo r employ ees to p ut in long-hous, take little o r time off, and be ready forwork last-minute work assignments. Blair-Lo’s (2004) qualita tive r esea rch illurated tha t there is indeed aperception that a mother cannot be fully commi tted to wo rk because she mut tend to her children’s needs. Inum, there is a belief that the ideal worker i s unresricted by family and can dedicate their full self to being aworker . Such norms foster negativi ty toward pregnan t women and mo thers, a s there is an inheren t belief thatthe y cannot be fully committed to the role of worker . Thus…Hypothesis 3: Managers who receiv e counte rtereo typic (vs. no) information about the commitmen t of p regnantjob applicants will display less interpersonal hostility toward them.InflexibilitInflexibility can be defined as unwillingne ss to compromise o r alter work schedule s to meet work demands. A spreviously disc used, social role theory ( Eagly, 1987) and the idea of intensive mo thering (Hays, 1996) help toexplain why women still perform the majority of household and childca re tasks ev en when perfo rming paid work(Bond, Thompson, Galinsk y, & Prottas, 2002). De spite a shift to mo re “family-f riendly” workplaces (Bianchi &Milkie, 2010; Kossek & Michel, 2010), the traditional model that work and family roles are incompatible pe rsis(Gr eenhaus & Beutell, 1985; Gr eenhaus & Powell, 2006). Thus, in o rder to comple tely f ulfill the role of wo rker, onemut be unconsrained from familial responsibilities that may limit one’s ability to conduct paid work. In ca ses inwhich there ar e perceiv ed consraints, the stereo type might emerge that the person with such consrain ts isinflexible and difficult. Given the song norms and perception tha t women a re the primary caregiv ers, there ar easumptions that mothers will be difficul t to work with or inflexible in their time and/or app roach to work.Hoobler, Wayne, and Lemmon (2009) ev en argued that all women, whether mothers o r no t, experience “family–work conflict bias,” because of their responsibilities in the home. But the perception s of these conflicts may beheightened by the visual cue of pregnanc y which se rv es as a reminder that the pregnan t employ ee will soon hav ea baby and hence, a perceiv ed home inflexibilit. As such, it is not hard to imagine ho w employ ees might percei v ethat a woman (vs. a man) will hav e more inte ruptions or consrain ts during the work day and that women andmothe rs are inflexible workers who cannot fully dedicate themselves to the job, as the “ideal worker ” should. Itfollows that…Hypothesis 4: Managers who receiv e counte rtereo typic (vs. no) information about the flexible wo rk av ailabilitof pregnant job applicants will display less interpersonal hostility toward them.Need for AccommodationChildbirth is a ph ysical experience for women that results in mo st of them taking some time off from work tor ecov er and bond wi th their newborns. It is sometimes difficult for employ ers and employ ees to fully embracetheir coworkers’ birthing e xperience beca use of the perception tha t these new mothers will need prolongedassistance and/or accommodation in the workplace. Federal la ws such a s the Pr egnancy Discrimination Act of1978 (2006) and the Family and Medical Leav e Act 1993 (2006) ense that pregnan t women receiv e faireatment in the workplace and can require employ ers to make accommoda tions for them. Extan t disabilitr esearch suggess that individual s (i.e., employ ees) mak e judgmen ts about the need for, and fairness of,rystsstsystssttttrsyrtsyurtryt accommoda tion (Colella, 2001). Any perceiv ed inequity in roles and responsibilitie s may arise and creater esentment among the employ ee s ( Gr eenberg & Cropanzano, 2001). In fact, resea rch sugge ss tha t cowo rkerr eact nega tively towa rd employ ee s receiving pregnancy and childbearing- related accommodations (Gates,Akabas, & Oran-Sabia, 1998) and that challenges in relationship s with cowo rkers abo ut these isues a rewidespread (Gates, Akabas, & Kantowitz, 1996).Although “normal” pregnancy is cuently not cov er ed unde r the Ame ricans with Disabilities Act some legalexpers a rgue that it should be cov er ed (Cox, 2012). The in ten t of these legal effors is arguably to adequa telyprotect pregnant women, howev er, increasing accommodation in the workplace may, in fact, create situations inwhich employ ers are r esentful or fearful of hiring pregnan t women. Such accommoda tions (e.g., limited expo seto chemicals, limited ov ertime hous) can be perceiv ed as buden some to employ ers and therefore indi viduals’possibly requi ring accommodation may encounte r negative in terpe rsonal teatmen t. Specifically, we p ropose thatpregnant women are ste reotyped as needing accommoda tion and therefore will be subject to in terpe rsonaldiscrimination. Thus…Hypothesis 5: Managers who receiv e counte rtereo typic ( vs. no) info rmation abo ut existing benefits andv acation time of pregnant job applican ts will display less inte rpersonal hostility towa rd them.MethodDesignThe cuent resea rch contains six conditions: nonp regnan t, pregnan t con tol, p regnan t displaying competence,pregnant displaying commitment, pregnant displaying flexibility, and pregnan t not needing an accommoda tion.Participa ting StoresIn line with previous research of Hebl et al. (2002), we identified and selected stores that confirmed they wereactively hiring for incl usion in the c uent sudy. A to tal of 161 stores in three malls located in a majorMetopolitan area were selected for inclusion in the cuen t sudy.Confederate Applicants, Ob serv ers, and Independent CoderFiv e undergradua te women participated as confedera te applicants in the sudy. Fiv e undergrad uates (threefemales, two males) serv ed as obse rv ers for each of the interaction s. In addition, three unde rgrad uate womenwho were una ware of the sudy’s purpose and conditions serv ed as independen t coders. All confederatesr emained blind to sudy hypotheses.Mate rialstssrrrtturrrrsrrrrrtrrrtsttt Confederate applicants wore standardiz ed attire that consisted of black shirs, dark blue jean s, low-heeled shoes,and wedding rings. In addition, confederate applicants carried a small black puue that con tained a digi tal a udio-r ecorder used to record each interac tion.TrainingPrior to collec ting data, all confederate applicants, observ ers, and independent coders were trained. Specifically,confederate applicants were giv en specific information abo ut the p rocedue (described belo w), familia rizedthemselves with the script, tried on and became used to the pregnancy p rostheses, and were giv en anopporunity to a sk any questions. Similarly, confedera te observ ers also were in sucted on the p rocedue andgiv en information about their specific duties as an observ er . Last, independent code rs, who remained blind to theudy’s purpose, conditions, and anything having to do with p regnancy a s the poin t of the sudy, we re trained tolisten to and make rating s based on audio-recorded interactions.ProcedueApplicants and observ ers utilized a standardiz ed procedue that mirored previous resea rch ( see Hebl et al., 2002,for a review). Specifically, confederate observ ers entered stores before confedera te applicants. Once in side,obse rv ers began looking at merchandise and poli tely declined any offers fo r help. Ob serv ers identified a centrallocation in the store in an effort to maximize the lik elihood that they could hear, see, and ev aluate theconversation between the confederate applicant and store personnel. Approximately 1 min after the observ erarrived in the store, the confederate applicant then entered and asked to speak to the manage r or pe rsonr esponsible for making hiring deci sions. When the manager emerged, the confedera te applicants began to enacta standa rdiz ed sc ript.Manipulations1. StigmaThe applicant’s stigma was manipulated miroring the methodology described by Hebl et al. (2007) in whichapplicants wore a pregnancy prosthe sis, or a foam pregnancy “belly” that was srapped around their waiss. Thi sprosthe sis enabled confederate applicants to be pe rceiv ed as being app roximately 5–6 months pregnant.2. Counte rtereotypic information conditionsWe dev eloped a number of remediation mechanisms based on p revious resea rch and pretest data. A total of 20gradua te sudents wi th significant work experience rated each sta temen t using a 5-poin t Likert-type scale (1 =Not at all, 5 = Completely). Statements that we re rated as (a) “most reflective,” (b) “lea st awkward,” and (c) “ mosr ealistic” of each of the four stereotypical belief s we described abo ut p regnancy were selected for inclusion in theudy.trsrttrrsttrrrrttsttst A. ContolIn this condi tion, applicants followed a memorized script that mirored fo rmer field sudie s (Hebl e t al., 2002; Heblet al., 2007; Singleta ry & Hebl, 2009). Specifically, applicants a sked three standard question s: (a) “Do you hav eany jobs?” (b) “Can I complete a job applica tion?” and (c) “What sors of things would I do if I wo rked her e?”B. Compe tencee dev eloped a script with information to inc rease perception s of the applicant’s competence; hence, theapplicant indicated that she had previous retail experience, puued a degree at a p restigio us instittion, andindica ted a belief tha t she would excel in a retail position. Individuals who p retested this sta tement ra ted it asv ery much reflective of competence (M = 3.63, SD = 0.81), approp ria te (M = 3.89, SD = 0.34), and realistic (M =3.63, SD = 0.72).C. Commi tmentThis script contained information that was designed to inc rease perception s of the applicant’s commitment to ajob and ov erall work ethic. Specifically, applicants shared info rma tion by p roviding the follo wing sta tement, “ I aman extemely dedicated pe rson who is willing to put in the work req uired to get the job done. People hav e al wayssaid one of my g reate st sength s is my commi tment to my work.” Petest data rev ealed that these statementwere v ery much indicative of commitment (M = 4.23, SD = 0.73), very approp ria te (M = 4.31, SD = 0.63), and veryr ealistic (M = 4.23, SD = 0.60).. Flexibili tyThis script contained information that was designed to inc rease the pe rception tha t the applican t ha s theav ailabili ty to work on demand. Specifically, applican ts shared the following info rmation : “My schedule is flexible.I ha v e the help I need so I can wo rk whenev er you need me.” Petess rev ealed that these statements were v erymuch indicative of flexibility (M = 4.54, SD = 0.78), very approp ria te (M = 3.92, SD = 0.64), and very realistic (M =3.92, SD = 0.76).E. Accommoda tionThe accommodation sc ript contained information that was designed to decrease any perception s tha t theapplicant would need prefer ential teatment. Applicants shared info rma tion that included the followingtatements, “I should let you know that I al ready ha v e health in srance so I won’t need benefits. I do hav e to tellyou that I will need to take off 2 weeks in January. Other than that, I won’t be taking off mo re time than your otheremploy ees.” Individual s who prete sted thi s statement rated it as somewha t reflecting that an accommodationwould be necessa ry (M = 2.87, SD = 0.92), approp ria te (M = 2.75, SD = 1.06), and realistic (M = 3.27, SD = 1.28).MeasesrrttWrsurtrrsDrtrsuur ormal discrimina tionormal discrimina tion was meased with two dichotomo us “ yes” and “no” items that included whetherapplicants were (a) told a job was av ailable and (b) allo wed to complete a job application.Interpe rsonal discriminationInterpe rsonal discrimination was meased from the perspective of the applican ts (Per ceiv ed Hostility),obse rv ers (Observ ed Hostility) and independent raters ( Coded Hostility).er cei v ed hostilitApplicants made ratings on six dimensions of the interaction, which were adap ted Hebl e t al.

Mo re impo rtan t, this is the firt sudy toexplore the provision of counte rtereotypic information a s a mechanism to remediate such disadvan tage andultimately facilitate pregnant women’s enty into the wo rkplace. In addition, this sudy expands upon previour esearch by examining the effec tivene ss of sev eral diff er en t forms of co untertereo typic information (i.e.,competence, commi tment, flexibility, and need for accommodation) to pinpoint theoretical drivers of p regnancydiscrimination and ul timately indi vidual and organizational approaches for its reduction.The ov erall pa ttern of results suggess that when hiring managers receiv e specific types of co unte rtereotypicinformation, they display le ss formal and interpersonal discrimination toward pregnan t job applicants.Specifically, r eceiving counte rtereotypic information designed to combat the stereo types of lack of commitment(Hypothesis 3) and inflexibility (Hypothesi s 4) reduced perception s of hostility across all pe rspectives. Thesefindings support a series of sudies that suggest countertereo typic information successf ully reducesdiscrimination against targe t individuals (Dasg upta & Asgari, 2004; Fisk e & Neuberg, 1990; Ka wakami et al., 2000King & Ahmad, 2010; King et al., 2006; Kunda & Sherman Williams, 1993; Miller & Kaiser, 2001).Interestingly, not all forms of counterte reotypic information reduced in terpersonal discrimination. Specifically,r eceiving informa tion that a pregnant job applican t was competen t or wo uld not req uire an accommodation didnot reduce the hostili ty display ed by hi ring managers. We propose that the stereo types of competence(Hypothesis 2) and need for accommodation (Hypothesi s 5) may not be the p rimary concern s of hiring managerin a retail setting, and therefore hostility remain s due to pe rception s of lack of commitmen t and/or inflexibilitywhich may be more r elev ant for retail job s. It is also plausible that beca use the stereo type of makingaccommoda tion is often perceiv ed as costly to the organization, the hiring manager may ha v e felt “legi timate” inhis or her concern ov er the pregnant job applican t’s capabilities and need s. Therefore, the information conditionof no need for accommoda tion may not hav e con vinced the hiring manager who may ha v e been acting to“protect” the organization f rom additional hardship. Need for accommoda tion seemed to be a concern of hiringmanagers and therefore we argue that the ste reo type wa s likely activated, but not effectively supp ressed by thisudy’s information manipula tion. Overall, the finding s f rom this sudy advance resea rch by examining specifictereotypes a ssocia ted with pregnant job applican ts and suggesting that mechanisms designed to reduceinte rpersonal discrimination should focus on combating induy-relev an t stereo types.sstrrrrstsrtsstssts;sssttsstr Not predic ted and somewhat srprisingly, the results also sho w tha t the provision of counte rtereo typicinformation influenced formal di scrimination. Unlike r ecent resea rch (Hebl et al., 2007), the cuen t sudy rev ealsthe presence of formal discrimination for one of the meases; nonpregnan t applican ts were giv en permi ssion tocomplete applications more often than pregnant applican ts. This finding sho uld be in terpreted with cautionbecause a second indicator of performance, job av ailability, did no t rev eal formal discrimina tion. One reason forthis finding is that tough economic times likely exacerba te the numbe r of women and mo thers on the job market(e.g., Gr eenhouse, 2009). This increased competition for positions may alter selection ratios creatingcir cumstances tha t may allow employ ers to feel jutified in their biase s in the selection process. Interestingly,and encouragingly, howev er, the provision of counterte reo typic information on one’s commitmen t, flexibility, orno need for accommodation effec tively red uced the presence of formal discrimination. In line with previour esearch, these results reinforce the eff ec tiveness of p roviding coun tertereo typic information a s a means tor educe both formal and interpe rsonal disc rimination towa rd pregnan t job applicants.Theoretical and Practical ImplicationsThe r e ar e se v eral theoretical and practical implica tions of the cuen t resea rch. A major theoretical contributionof this research is that it clarifies the nate of stereo typing to ward pregnan t job applicants. Specifically, sudyfindings confirm that, in retail se tting s, stereotypic belief s about pregnan t women’s commitmen t and flexibilityar e the lik ely drivers of interpersonal discrimination. Exploratory analyse s rev ealed that info rma tion on flexibility(i.e., work sched ule) wa s generally most effec tive. This finding is consistent with the job demands in a cutomerservice context wherein applicants’ schedule flexibility may be pa rticularly atractive. Indeed, we reason thatcontextual variables may influence when ce rtain co unte rtereo typic information may be most effective. Forinstance, in a job that requires a great deal of compe tence, information on relev an t experience o r education maybe more useful than information that focuse s on dispelling the notion that a woman who is p regnan t is likely tobe inflexible. Therefore, in a retail se tting, the stereo type of expectant mothers as inflexible is likely the key driverof hostility. Thi s finding is theoretically important, as it refines the nate of the beliefs toward pregnan t women,thus creating opporunity to dev elop ste reotype-prev en tive and corective in terv en tions.Second, the cuent research demonsrates that countertereo typic information effectively reduces managers’expressed prejudice. Thus, this finding reinforces p revious resea rch tha t demon srates that the provision ofcounterte reotypic information about targe ts can be successf ul in reducing their prejudice towa rd them (e.g.,Dasgupta & Asgari, 2004; Kawakami et al., 2000). Howev er, mo st of this past work ha s focused on attitudechange and not centrally on behavioral change, the la tter of which we examined successfully in the presentudy. The present sudy makes a theoretical con tribution to this body of resea rch by demon srating thatcounterte reotypic information may contribute to behavioral change during inte raction s with marginalizedindividuals.The sudy’s practical contrib ution is the iden tification of how to reduce discrimination to ward ma r ginalizedgroups. Although some ta rge ts may take it upon themselves to personally provide coun tertereo typicinformation to employ ers (see Neel, Nuefeld, & Neuberg, 2013; Shih, Young, & Bucher, 2013), we do not advocatethat the buden be placed on the victim to corect widesp read managerial p rejudice. Instead, we hopeorganizations take more r esponsibility to prev ent discrimina ting conduct on the part of its employ ees, especiallymanagement, in the interest of c reating a bias free workplace. This migh t be done in at least two plausible wayscompliance and di versi ty training. Fi rt, compliance training that happens in organization s is uually focused onensring organizational decision-makers follow rules and regulation s (Kra vitz, 2008). Our resea rch may providesome g uidance as to the types of information (i.e., coun tertereo typic) that should be included in such policies tousrrturssssrrurtstsurtrrrtstsstttstsrr:ssus protect targets of employment disc rimination. Recent resea rch ha s sho wn that attitude and behavior change i smost effecti ve when done more often rather than solely upon entrance upon an o rganization (Madera, King, &Hebl, in pres). We believ e that reminding people not only abo ut laws and policy ( see Ba ron & Hebl, 2012) bualso countertereotypical information will help organization s create and foste r workplace en vironments wherethere is zero-tolerance for disc rimination.Second, diversity training consiss of initiatives de signed to facilita te positive in terpersonal in teractions acrossocial identity groups and red uce disc rimination to ward ma r ginalized group s (Pendry, Driscoll, & Field, 2007).Re search on di versity training rev eals mixed r esults (Kulik & Roberson, 2008), and there is real need fo r moreempirically based initiati ves that are effec tive, particularly given tha t two thirds of o rganization s engage indiv ersity training (Esen, 2005). The findings from o ur resea rch p rovide specific foci fo r effective div ersity trainingthat may lead to attitudinal and behavior change. For example, o rganizational dev elopmen t o r h uman resoucedepartments could integ rate information into exi sting diversity training prog rams that con tradicts commonlyheld stereotypes of pregnant workers (or othe r marginalized group s). Organization s could en se managerr eceiv e this informa tion from a variety of souces such as o rganizational members (e.g., allies in the o rganization,organizational leaders) and/or medium s (e.g., handbook s, testimonials, video s). Recent evidence providesupport that telling people not only what they are lea rning (e.g., coun tertereo typical information) a s well as whythe y are learning it (e.g., to hav e a more accurate undertanding) is effective (King, Gulik, & Avery, 2010). Futher,r esearch has recently shown that individ uals who set goals in diversity training sessions, in line with reducinguch prejudice, show significantly red uced discrimination some 6 mon ths later (Madera, King, & Hebl, in pres).Hence, effors to ense div ersi ty training programs involve the p resen tation of coun tertereo typical informationabout targets, including addressing underlying atti tudes and enco uraging focused behavioral change, might bev ery eff ective in reducing prej udice and di scrimination.Despite the seemingly posi tive outcomes of compliance and diversity training we recognize there ar e sengths,weaknesses, and considerations of any approach to reducing employmen t discrimination (see Lindsey, King,Dunleavy, McCa usland, & Jones, in pres) that should be f ully considered before implementa tion. A con side rationof integrating countertereotypic information about targets in to compliance and diversity training programs isthat this approach emphasizes identity g roup differ ences, rather than focusing on themes of diversity (Roberson,2006; Thomas, Tran, & Dawson, 2010), which may, in fact, create resistance to diversity (Thomas, 2008) ratherthan inclusion. We ar e hopeful fue r esearch might specifically examine the provision of coun tertereotypicalinformation in compliance and diversi ty training so as to create inclusion in, and promo te, diverse workplace s.Limita tions and Fe ResearchThe r e ar e se v eral a v enues for fue r esearch that would clarify sudy findings and facili tate undertanding of thechallenges that pregnant women face at work. Firt, al though this sudy provides insight on the prev alence ofinte rpersonal discrimination more r esearch i s needed on formal discrimination. Fe r esea rch can and shouldidentify other manifestations of formal disc rimination against pregnan t job applicants and whethe r the reductionof interpe rsonal discrimination is “enough” to secue pregnan t job applicants a job offer or whether fo rmaldiscrimination will present a final barrier to en ty. A second limitation of this resea rch is tha t we acknowledge itattempts to redr ess stereotyping by making the victim the agent that corects the stereo type. In this sudy, thepregnant job applicant enacted a sc ript that provided coun tertereo typic information. Altho ugh findingsdemonsrate that the provision of counterte reo typic information effectively reduced discrimination, additionalr esearch should consider how organizations can target stereo type-p rev en tive and corective in terv en tions tor emov e the buden from the victim. Fe r esearch sho uld consider varied souces of the co untertereotypicsrtstsrursrsssrssturstrsstursuturturtsstuturrrrtstsrruturrs information to determine from whom (e.g., human reso uce p rof essional, senior leadership) and how (e.g., writtenhandbooks or manuals, videos, testimonials from hiring managers) info rma tion sho uld be receiv ed to moseffec tively reduce formal and interpersonal di scrimination. A final limita tion of this resea rch is tha t it wa sconducted in a retail se tting, which i s often characterized by a tempo rary wo rkforce who a re no t eligible forcertain organizational benefi ts. This begs the question of whether our findings wo uld generalize to other types ofjob se ttings or contexts, particularly those that are stereo typed a s more prof essional jobs. Fe r esearch mayconsider manifestations of disc rimination and corective info rma tion-based in terv en tions in p rof essional, full-time job setting s as well as male and female sex-typed jobs in order to be able to generalize the findings of thisr esearch.ConclusionOuside the workplace, pregnant women are r ev er ed, protected, and cherished (Hebl et al., 2007). Inside, howev er,pregnant women face interpersonal obstacles that stand in the way of their successf ul employmen t. The c uentr esearch goes beyond simply confirming such challenges to iden tify and empirically test real, p racticalmechanisms to help women ov er come pregnancy discrimination. In so doing, we discov er that the dominantideologies tha t underlie di scrimination toward p regnan t women applying for cutome r service po sition s involvesflexibility, and to a lesser extent, commitment. Together, these findings can d rive fue schola rship andorganizational practice supporting gender equali ty.Refer ences1.Baron,L. G.,&Hebl, M. R.(2012).
