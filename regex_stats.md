# Statistics Match by RegEx

This list of statistics is complied manually through readings of articles and translating the reported statistics into RegEx format. 

----
**Update 2 (25 March 2020)**

Completed reviewing a sample of 33 articles and captured the various styles of formats for research statistics.

Next step: convert into RegEx patterns for extraction.

**Update 1 (1 March 2020)**

Currently going through past research articles and capturing styles of formats for research statistics. Left off at "R."
